# Fedi Bot

Make sure you have created a PostgreSQL DB with credentials found in `config/dev.exs`.

To start your Bot / Phoenix server:

  * Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

To connect the bot to your any Mastodon account
- register and login
- then follow the instructions on http://localhost:4000

# Todo 

- [x] Persist tokens gotten from fedi
- [x] Post text + image
- ~~Refresh token if expired (cant ? at least not user token w/o interaction from user)~~
- [x] Login protect dev/dashboard 
- [x] Login protect connect fedi account page
- [x] Enter fedi url to connect to 
- [x] Ability to update/reset bot fedi config (delete the credentials.json file + clear agent states)
- [x] Trigger RSS reposter job from ui 
- [x] Add CRON job to read and re-post RSS feeds
- [x] Track/save posts in memory to prevent dupes
- [x] Block registration after 1 user signed up (becomes admin this way)
- [x] Make deploy/publish ready if needed (scripts etc.?)
- [x] Use Logger.info instead of IO.* for logging important messages
- [ ] Enter fedi url from pleroma or soapbox or misskey or other popular fediware (needs more code, wont be just oauth I think...)

  - [x] RSS URLs
  - [x] Dry run mode
